# Typing Spanish/Portuguese + UK Keyboard + Linux

## Setup

In settings select keyboard layout: **`English (UK, extended, with WIN keys)`**

## Typing non-english characters

Accent        | Examples | Keystrokes
------------- |:--------:| ----------:
acute         | á é í    | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `<key>`
grave         | à è ì    | `` ` `` :arrow_right: `<key>`
circumflex    | â ê î    | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `^` :arrow_right: `<key>`
umlaut        | ä ë ï    | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `"` :arrow_right: `<key>`
tilde         | ã ẽ ñ    | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `~` :arrow_right: `<key>`
c cedilla     | ç        | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `c`
upside-down ? | ¿        | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `Shift` :heavy_plus_sign: `-`
upside-down ! | ¡        | `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `Shift` :heavy_plus_sign: `!`

### weird keys

The `AltGr` key is normally just to the right of the space-bar. Grave accents are typed using the `` ` `` key (known as the back-tick key), which is normally at the top-left of the keyboard) under the escape key. 

### how to interpret the table above 

- :heavy_plus_sign: means press keys together

- :arrow_right: means press keys sequentially. 

For example to type `ñ`: lookup tilde in the table and replace `<key>` with **`n`** giving: `AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `~` :arrow_right: `n`, which means: 
- press the `AltGr` and `~` keys together (then release them)
- press the **`n`** key.

(Note that typing ¡ and ¿ require 3 keys pressed together.)

### capital letters with accents

Capital letters are obtained using the same keystrokes as their lower-case equivalents except that the `Shift` key is pressed with the final keystroke. For example to type `Ñ`begin with the table entry for `ñ` but end with `Shift` :heavy_plus_sign: `n` instead of just `n` :

`AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `~` :arrow_right: `Shift` :heavy_plus_sign: `n`, which means:
- press the `AltGr` and `~` keys together (then release them)
- press the **`Shift`** and **`n`** keys together.

### remembering the keystokes

The keystrokes should be easy to remember: a grave accent looks like a back-tick `` ` ``, a circumflex looks like a ^ and an umlaut looks (a bit) like ". The only one that makes no sense is ¿ (`AltGr` :heavy_plus_sign: `Shift` :heavy_plus_sign: `-`) which just has to be memorized :disappointed:.
